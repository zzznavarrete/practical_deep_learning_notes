## Practical deep learning for coders.

This repo contains code *(mostly jupyter notebooks)*, notes (I suggest to visualize it through Obsidian) and also mini projects that are developed in the course "Practical Deep Learning for Coders" *(https://course.fast.ai/)**

### Repository structure
- **notebooks:** personal_notes/notebooks
- **notes:** personal_notes/personal_notes_obsidian
- **projects:** projects/


Many thanks to Jeremy Howard to create such an amazing course, it's almost unbeliavable that amazing content beign freely distributed, thanks Jeremy.
